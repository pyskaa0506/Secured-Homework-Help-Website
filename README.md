# Secured-Homework-Help-Website
## Project Overview
A secure-by-design web platform enabling students to request help and helpers to provide solutions, with credit-based interactions forming the core workflow. The application focuses on strong authentication, strict role separation, and hardened request handling to prevent common web vulnerabilities. Developed as part of Secure Programming classes, the project highlights security-focused development practices within a minimal Flask environment to demonstrate how even simple applications require robust protection and threat mitigation.
